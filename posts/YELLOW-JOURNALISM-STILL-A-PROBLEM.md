# An admission that lefty yellow journalism does exist, with the Washington Post as a great example. [Editorial]  

The Trump administration has criticized the media claiming that the New York Times, Washington Post, and other major media news outlets are fake news.  We are quick to defend these outlets, often because it’s so clear that the news Trump is watching is even more fake.  Whether or not the news we are consuming is fake is open to debate, but I think that a lot of the news we are consuming is crappy yellow journalism.    It’s OK (and often good) for informed citizens to care about issues and be impassioned to boycott, protest, and vote.  It’s not OK for trusted media to take on an opinionated tone though, even you agree with the tone.  Human emotion speaks louder than content, and so finding media that does not emote, allows us to shape our own opinions without clouding our judgment.

Here is a segment from a Washington Post piece on February 16 2017, with charged language emphasized by me.

"President Trump on Thursday aired his grievances against the news media, the intelligence community **and his detractors** generally in a **sprawling, stream-of-consciousness** news conference that alternated between claims that he had “inherited a mess” and the assertion that his **fledgling** administration “is running like a fine-tuned machine.”[1]

“To be honest, I inherited a mess,” Trump said, in a news conference that lasted more than an hour and was at times **rambling, combative and pointed.** “It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country.”[1]

[The above is from the Washington Post, Peter Baker of the New York Times wrote an article on the same topic, which avoids some of the charged language in the Post piece, but not all of it [5].  ]

Some of the journalism in the WP "Politics" section is marked “Analysis." this stuff can use opinionated language because it is obviously editorial.  The item above is in the "Post Politics" section.  The Post Politics section does not suggest it is an editorial section but a huge amount of the writing uses charged language and verbiage that makes a bias clear.  The URL for post politics is also strange.  The index page is under /blogs (suggesting the content may be editorial), but each article link is instead under the /news slug, making it hard to tell that the articles within this section are often opinion pieces, or at least not making any attempt to be objective.


Washington Post also appears to order their columns on the website in order of popularity, not credibility, putting Politics (which for the Washington Post is heavily opinion articles), Opinion, and Sports section links first in the sidebar and following them by other more newsy sections.


Another thing about the Posts website is that often the URL in the bar seems to say one thing while an article says another.  For example, 4 subsections under "Politics" end up with a URL that includes the word blogs (showing that these are basically opinion sections), but the pages for the articles themselves make no mention that this is a blog section, usually just saying "Politics" at the top of the page.

This quote from WP is has a url that places it in the business/ecomomy section, but at the top of the page says Politics.  

"And the tiny township of Bedminster, N.J., is preparing for the daunting prospect that the local Trump golf course will serve as a sort of northern White House for as many as 10 weekends a year.” [2]

[The WP quote above is not mentioning a factual statement, it’s almost more of a joke suggesting Trump will be taking a lot of vacations]

Items that don't fall under the blog subsection in WP Politcs are not necessarily lacking in an opinionated tone though.

‘ “I’m not ranting and raving,” President Trump insisted Thursday, 47 minutes into a 77-minute tempest of a news conference in which he did just that.’ ’ [3]

In fact, the only politics section which has it's index page under the "news" subsection URL is "PowerPost" which claims it " delivers essential intelligence for D.C. decision-makers.".  But a few moments on the PowerPost page revels that it too is very yellow as far as journalism goes.

"President Trump is responding to the crisis involving ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn by criticizing — **who else?** — the media.” [4]

"**Of course,** the press isn’t the only target of Trump’s anger — he also criticized members of the intelligence community.” [4]

The main page of the Washington Post also seems to be marketing articles lacking in substance.  It is extremely focused on Politics, opting to show primarily articles like the ones shown above (many of the above are or were on the main page) in lieu of better researched articles in other sections.

Finally, clicking on the authors names of these pieces reveals an ‘author page’ showing their other published pieces and a title for the author.  All of the above articles have authors who are cited as “reporter” and not as “analyst”, “columnist”, “commentator”, or some other title that would suggest they are not an objective journalist.


Other New Outlets:  While this writeup dwells on the Washington Post, the Post is not the only well respected news source that seems to be engaging in yellow journalism.  I think it’s possible that the massive media wars and distrust of the media are in large part rooted in media not trusting individuals to make their own decisions based on factual information, and instead spoon-feeding us opinionated pieces with little substance in order to maximize shares on social media.

Final Thoughts:

Along with misleading readers into thinking they are reading news articles which are in fact color commentary or opinion, publishing news articles which include heavily charged or colorful language, and prioritizing opinion and color commentary on the front page or main section, lots of articles quote anonymous sources with no real reason for allowing their source to remain anonymous. 
It is bad journalism to keep almost all sources anonymous.  While whistleblowers are often afforded protection for good reason (and usually later made public), it is negligent to frequently publish articles based on information unverifiable by others.    When a source wishes to remain anonymous, a good journalist should seek out another source. When an article simply mentions “sources close to […]” or “according to reports..” that article is begging the reader to put all trust in the journal, an unfair request to make of a reader in a day in age in which tremendous amounts of news are simply fake.
