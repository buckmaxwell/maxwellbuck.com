# An admission that lefty yellow journalism does exist, with the Washington Post
 as a great example. [Editorial]‚Ä®‚Ä®

The Trump administration has criticized the media claiming that the New York Tim
es, Washington Post, and other major media news outlets are fake news.  We are q
uick to defend these outlets, often because it‚Äôs so clear that the news Trump 
is watching is even more fake.  Whether or not the news we are consuming is fake
 is open to debate, but I think that a lot of the news we are consuming is crapp
y yellow journalism.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®It‚Äôs OK (and often good) for informed citizens to 
care about issues and be impassioned to boycott, protest, and vote.  It‚Äôs not 
OK for trusted media to take on an opinionated tone though, even you agree with 
the tone.  Human emotion speaks louder than content, and so finding media that d
oes not emote, allows us to shape our own opinions without clouding our judgment
.

Here is a segment from a Washington Post piece on February 16 2017, with charged
 language emphasized by me.

"President Trump on Thursday aired his grievances against the news media, the in
telligence community **and his detractors** generally in a **sprawling, stream-o
f-consciousness** news conference that alternated between claims that he had ‚Äú
inherited a mess‚Äù and the assertion that his **fledgling** administration ‚Äúi
s running like a fine-tuned machine.‚Äù[1]

‚ÄúTo be honest, I inherited a mess,‚Äù Trump said, in a news conference that la
sted more than an hour and was at times **rambling, combative and pointed.** ‚Äú
It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country.‚Äù
[1]

[The above is from the Washington Post, Peter Baker of the New York Times wrote 
an article on the same topic, which avoids some of the charged language in the P
ost piece, but not all of it [5].  ]

Some of the journalism in the WP "Politics" section is marked ‚ÄúAnalysis." this
 stuff can use opinionated language because it is obviously editorial.  The item
 above is in the "Post Politics" section.  The Post Politics section does not su
ggest it is an editorial section but a huge amount of the writing uses charged l
anguage and verbiage that makes a bias clear.  The URL for post politics is also
 strange.  The index page is under /blogs (suggesting the content may be editori
al), but each article link is instead under the /news slug, making it hard to te
ll that the articles within this section are often opinion pieces, or at least n
ot making any attempt to be objective.


Washington Post also appears to order their columns on the website in order of p
opularity, not credibility, putting Politics (which for the Washington Post is h
eavily opinion articles), Opinion, and Sports section links first in the sidebar
 and following them by other more newsy sections.


Another thing about the Posts website is that often the URL in the bar seems to 
say one thing while an article says another.  For example, 4 subsections under "
Politics" end up with a URL that includes the word blogs (showing that these are
 basically opinion sections), but the pages for the articles themselves make no 
mention that this is a blog section, usually just saying "Politics" at the top o
f the page.

This quote from WP is has a url that places it in the business/ecomomy section, 
but at the top of the page says Politics.  

"And the tiny township of Bedminster, N.J., is preparing for the daunting prospe
ct that the local Trump golf course will serve as a sort of northern White House
 for as many as 10 weekends a year.‚Äù [2]

[The WP quote above is not mentioning a factual statement, it‚Äôs almost more of
 a joke suggesting Trump will be taking a lot of vacations]

Items that don't fall under the blog subsection in WP Politcs are not necessaril
y lacking in an opinionated tone though.

‚Äò ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ranting and raving,‚Äù President Trump insisted Thursday, 47 mi
nutes into a 77-minute tempest of a news conference in which he did just that.‚Ä
ô ‚Äô [3]

In fact, the only politics section which has it's index page under the "news" su
bsection URL is "PowerPost" which claims it " delivers essential intelligence fo
r D.C. decision-makers.".  But a few moments on the PowerPost page revels that i
t too is very yellow as far as journalism goes.

"President Trump is responding to the crisis involving ex-national security advi
ser Michael Flynn by criticizing ‚Äî **who else?** ‚Äî the media.‚Äù [4]

"**Of course,** the press isn‚Äôt the only target of Trump‚Äôs anger ‚Äî he also
 criticized members of the intelligence community.‚Äù [4]

The main page of the Washington Post also seems to be marketing articles lacking
 in substance.  It is extremely focused on Politics, opting to show primarily ar
ticles like the ones shown above (many of the above are or were on the main page
) in lieu of better researched articles in other sections.

Finally, clicking on the authors names of these pieces reveals an ‚Äòauthor page
‚Äô showing their other published pieces and a title for the author.  All of the
 above articles have authors who are cited as ‚Äúreporter‚Äù and not as ‚Äúanaly
st‚Äù, ‚Äúcolumnist‚Äù, ‚Äúcommentator‚Äù, or some other title that would sugges
t they are not an objective journalist.


Other New Outlets:‚Ä®‚Ä®While this writeup dwells on the Washington Post, the Po
st is not the only well respected news source that seems to be engaging in yello
w journalism.  I think it‚Äôs possible that the massive media wars and distrust 
of the media are in large part rooted in media not trusting individuals to make 
their own decisions based on factual information, and instead spoon-feeding us o
pinionated pieces with little substance in order to maximize shares on social me
dia.

Final Thoughts:

Along with misleading readers into thinking they are reading news articles which
 are in fact color commentary or opinion, publishing news articles which include
 heavily charged or colorful language, and prioritizing opinion and color commen
tary on the front page or main section, lots of articles quote anonymous sources
 with no real reason for allowing their source to remain anonymous.‚Ä®
It is bad journalism to keep almost all sources anonymous.  While whistleblowers
 are often afforded protection for good reason (and usually later made public), 
it is negligent to frequently publish articles based on information unverifiable
 by others.    When a source wishes to remain anonymous, a good journalist shoul
d seek out another source. When an article simply mentions ‚Äúsources close to [
‚Ä¶]‚Äù or ‚Äúaccording to reports..‚Äù that article is begging the reader to pu
t all trust in the journal, an unfair request to make of a reader in a day in ag
e in which tremendous amounts of news are simply fake.
