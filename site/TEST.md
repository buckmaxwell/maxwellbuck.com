# Background By Reddit

Hey Guys,

I was bored between classes a few days ago and decided it would be cool to [stre










































am pictures posted on Reddit to my desktop background](https://github.com/buckma










































xwell/background-by-reddit).  Reddit has a really neat API in that every page th










































at is publicly assessable normally, can be converted to JSON  simply by [appendi










































ng .json to the end of the regular URL](https://www.reddit.com/.json?raw_json=1)










































.

Then, to limit calls all they do is have you set your User-Agent string in the r










































equest header to something fun and playful for the requests that you make.  If y










































our User-Agent is set to the default -- ie, you use urllib for Python or somethi










































ng like that, and don't set the User-Agent in the header on your own--then in a 










































little bit you'll get a 429 status code.  So sad.  So come up with something cre










































ative and you can make 60 requests a minute.  If you need to double that, or hit










































 some endpoints that would only be assessable to a signed in user, then use Oaut










































h (ug, I know).

But anyway, the Reddit API kicks ass, so I hooked everything up in about 45 minu










































tes and tossed it up on GitHub.  Hope you have fun with it! I was very satisfied










































 with the results, and have been experimenting with different subreddits in orde










































r to increase the fun.  For an extra challenge, set it up on your friends comput










































er, and watch with delight as they try to figure out where all these pictures of










































 Vladimir Putin and Teacup Pigs are coming from.
