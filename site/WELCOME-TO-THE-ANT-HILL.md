# I think we should be more ant-like!  

I recently moved to New York City, and since I've been here, I've watched 3 docu
mentaries about ants.  I cannot lie, the city reminds me of an ant hill.  Ever b
uzzing, large, distributed, ordered but chaotic.  This is actually an appealing 
thing for me.  I love ants.  They are underground fungus gardeners and aphid she
perds.  The only bug to raise another bug as cattle. But most of all, I am impre
ssed by their trust in one another.  To such a high degree do they trust, that t
he term 'hive-mind' is often applied to them -- they act as if they share a coll
ective conciousness. Rather than worrying about 'becoming ants' in the Orwelian 
sense, I wonder how individuals can embrace each others individuality so fully t
hat they trust them to build, implement, and live without strict regulation to i
mpede the process. Indeed, I must admit that while I complain about the overregu
lation and deep bureacracy in place to control how the poor spend their welfare 
checks, I am quite pleased that we have strict regulations on the oil industry -
- and I wish they were stricter! I don't trust oil tycoons, it is my personal bi
as. But if somehow I could trust that I, like the poor, and the oil tycoons were
 all just part of a great distributed system relying on mutual trust, maybe, we'
d all be better off.

## Welcome to the ant hill 

Ants are cool, for all sorts of reasons. Perhaps one of the most interesting thi
ngs about them, is that despite the enormous size of their colonies -- some supe
r colonies have 300 million ant or more -- they do not require a centralized con
trolling body to govern their society.  It is deceiving that we refer to a certa
in ant as the Queen.  It is true she is important, but only because she births t
he entire colony -- she defers all decision making to her children.

If an ant hill was a trivial thing to run, perhaps this would not excite me so m
uch, but believe me, it is not. For example, in a single leaf cutter ant hill, a
 whole host of roles exist for worker ants. Cutter Ants slice through leaves wit
h their strong mandibles and let them fall to the ground for Transporter Ants to
 carry back to the hill (marching 2 by 2 hurrah! hurrah!).  Gardeners, take the 
leaves into the depths of the colony, bringing them to specialized gardening roo
ms where the leaves are left to decompose and become fertilizer for a special fu
ngus that the Gardener Ants grow as food.  Since leaf decomposition and fungus g
rowth produces carbon dioxide which is poisonous to oxygen breathing ants, the c
olony must be built so that CO2 leaves the hill, and oxygen replaces it. Since t
here is no 'Architect Ant' specialty, all ants must assist in tunnel design and 
digging whenever necessary. 

Furthermore, the number of ants needed to fill each role changes based on circum
stance. Leaf cutters have another type of subteranean worker called a Soldier An
t.  Soldiers each patrol a small area of the colony, walking back and forth like
 a dilligent mall cop. If a disturbance happens anywhere in the colony though, t
he Soldiers are quick on the scene, and very effective (they've been documented 
to have successfully protected colonies from bears). The number of Soldiers nece
ssary in a colony is not static of course -- it waxes and wanes depending on cur
rent threats.  *Amazingly,* with no centralized authority, ants generally have t
he right number of soldiers, not too many and not to few.  The Nursery Ants, who
 spend their days rearing their larval sisters, feed the larvae according to the
ir future specialty, and adjust their numbers based on the current needs of the 
colony. Ants fed in one way will become large Soldiers, others efficent and spee
dy Transporters.  Still another might be fed a diet that will make her into her 
mother's successor.  

## Ruling with no King

Over Christmas, my Aunt Christine gifted me with a collaborative game called Han
abi. The goal of this card game is to 'create a fireworks display' by placing ca
rds on the table in the correct order.  Each player can see her teammates cards,
 but not her own.  The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, num
bered 1–5 in each color.  For each color, the players try to place a row in th
e correct order from 1–5.  The cards have different numbers based on value, bu
t there are some duplicates.  It takes 25 cards to win the game, and the deck is
 50, which means up to 25 can be discarded. There are a few things working again
st you though.

 1. *Information sharing is limited.* Sharing information with a teammate about 
her cards is the key to getting her to play the right ones in the future, but it
's not a free for all.  Information sharing costs a Time Token.  Since Time Toke
ns can only be bought by discarding cards, and since a limited number of cards c
an be discarded, there is only so much you can say. Also, the pieces of informat
ion that are shareable follow a strict set of guidlines.

 2. *Mistakes will cost you.* Since the information highway in this game has the
 bandwith of a narrow mountain pass, it makes some sense to take some chances.  
After all, out of 50 cards, only 25 are needed to win the game right? Not quite.
 3 mistakes and you're done, that's all you get.  Also, since there is only 5 5'
s in the whole game if you throw one of these away by accident, your ruined fire
works blow you up immedietly. Tough luck Uncle Sam.

***It's a trust game.*** The key, is to give your partner large pieces of inform
ation rather than specific and obvious ones.  This takes full advantage of our l
imited information sharing bandwith. It's hard to do though, for those of us who
 like being in control, because it leaves the decision making completely up to o
ur teammate.

For example, I might notice my partner has a yellow 2 that is actionable -- ther
e is a yellow 1 on the board. I might be tempted to tell him 'YOU HAVE A 2' loud
ly, in hopes that he will confidently play it assuming that I have not told him 
such specific information without purpose.  This will probably work for this tur
n, but in sharing with your teammate such limited information about his hand, yo
u have made it so he is in the dark about his hand once again after this turn!  
Had you only had patience *you could have maximized instead of specified.*

In Hanabi, information sharing means revealing all of the cards of a specific co
lor or number.  So you can say, 'THESE 3 CARDS ARE YELLOW'. Next turn, I might t
ell him which of his cards match a number, and save my highly specific informati
on for times of truly high impact, ie 'THIS CARD IS A 5'. By maximizing informat
ion tidbits we create a highly informed teammate, and can trust them to make the
 best decision because of the information we've given them.  *By saying 'YOU HAV
E A 2' we are attempting to be the King.*  By maximizing information flow, we ar
e saying, I trust you to dig the tunnel.

## Relinquishing control means radical trust, and hopefully, radical efficency

*Trust is efficent.*  If you've seen 'Split or Steal', read about Game Theory, o
r seen A Beautiful Mind, you know this. Recently, I stumbled upon a videogame ve
rsion of some game theory problems which is beautifully illustrated and very tho
ught provoking.

*It's also risky.* Trust means you are not in control all the time, and it means
 you can get screwed.  Naivete is not what I preach, but I do enjoy exploring wh
at it would mean to employ trust as a convention in more places.  Trust is alrea
dy the convention in more places than you might think about -- from red lights a
nd stop signs, to wall mounted shelves sized according to the distance between s
tuds specified in local building codes, to software that relies on other softwar
e and trusts it's semantic versioning schemes and API documentation .  Imagine t
he ineffient society that must create a temporary impassible barrier in order to
 avoid accidents at even the quietest intersections. Imagine the time and money 
that could be saved if we trusted each other in more places.  

## Start the movement by starting

Last evening, on the subway, a man boarded and asked for change. As someone new 
to NYC, I imagined this was an incredibly common occurrence and expected he'd be
 ignored.  I'm sure that on other trains in the city this is often the case.  Th
at night though, a great number of different people gave him change, not a singl
e one gave him paper money, but so many handed him something and each one looked
 in his eye and wished him luck. I only had a 20 dollar bill in my pocket and wa
s unwilling to part with it that evening, but the next day, I filled my pocket w
ith some change, hoping to be part of the small trust based system that had doub
tlessly amassed enough change to make an out-of-luck man's day a little bit bett
er.  While each one could have thought his 2 quarters unworthy and so not bother
ed to give them, the collective effort had impact, on the man, and also, on my f
uture behavior.

The first person who gave change to this man had the most trust. She was trustin
g that someone else on the train would give money too and make her money less wo
rthless and more impactful. Had she not started by eagerly giving some change, t
he others might not have given any money.  By being the first to give a few quar
ters on a train, she gave a man enough for a meal.

The lesson here is two-fold.  *Start the movement by starting, and be part of th
e movement when it's happening.*
