<p>If you love Google Analytics great. I've used it plenty and have only recently gone ahead and cut it out of my site as I wander down the path of technical minimalism.  Keep in mind I still track my users, but the things I actually cared about in GA were so simple to gather on my own that a self-built version had very little technical overhead (think 2.5 hour time investment) and allowed me to cut <em>Google's prying eyes</em> out of the picture while sparing my users from having to run JavaScript and fill their browsers with an absolutely goofy amount of cookies, not to mention an extra HTTP request being made for <em>every single page</em> on my website.</p>

<a id="user-content-what-i-liked-about-ga" class="anchor" href="#what-i-liked-about-ga" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I liked about GA</h2>
<p>There is a few things I like about GA.  It can tell me</p>
<ol>
<li>Where my visitors are from</li>
<li>How they got to my site</li>
<li>The path they took through the site</li>
<li>Whether they use a mobile device</li>
<li>Whether they are a new or returning visitor</li>
<li>How long they stayed on pages</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the type of sites you run, you may care about different things than I do, but I believe that these metrics tend to be the most useful regardless of site purpose and discipline.  It should be mentioned that other metrics can be derivied from this information.  A cursory read of <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview" rel="nofollow">this Google Analytics page</a> will show you that Google's code is not really doing that much.  The JavaScript code that Google Analytics uses is not what gathers information about referrals, or IP addresses, and it's not what Google uses to determine whether the visitor is a new or returning visitor.  Google makes it clear that the JavaScript running on the page is gathering extra information from 'the DOM [which] provides access to more detailed browser and system information, such as Java and Flash support and screen resolution'.  While this may sound cool, as a site manager, it's actually not that interesting to me what the screen resolution of my average client is...</p>

<p>Those 6 core metrics are actually pretty easy to record.  IP address information, referals, and the User-Agent are all possible to determine from the headers.  While each of these things is trust-based, as a user could set the headers to whatever they feel like, most folks are using a browser and browsers tend to respect convention.  This information alone, all tacked on to the header, is enough to provide answers for 1-4.</p>
<p>The 5th question can be answered with a simple long lasting session cookie. The 6th is hard to answer conclusively no matter what.  Information about the DOM helps to create a better answer for this question, but clickthrough rate is possibly equally useful.</p>
<p>So if these metrics can be obtained without running 3rd party code on a site, why does everyone do it?  I believe it's the pretty graphs and charts.  Nice user friendly dashboards (even one's that we should admit don't tell us all that much) are nice.  My next step will be to build a killer dashboard for my site.  When I do, I'll let you know.</p>

<a id="user-content-so-how-exactly-are-you-tracking-me" class="anchor" href="#so-how-exactly-are-you-tracking-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So how exactly are you tracking me?</h2>
<p>The way I track users is effective but primitive. If you are a new user to my site, you'll access a page of the site and your browser will not send any cookies.  My server will see that and so along with the webpage you requested, it will send back a cookie with the suggestion that your browser store it.  I do this by setting a Set-Cookie header on the response.  My Set-Cookie response header looks something like this.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-httpspec"><pre><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-v">Set-Cookie:</span> ooh_so_tasty=PhyllisBeverlySealPage9120; Expires=Wed, 01 Jan 2116 23:00:00 GMT;</span></pre></div>
<p>If you haven't set your browser to do differently, it will remember this cookie is associated with my site, and pass it along with every request to my site for the next 100 years (when the cookie will finally expire).  I will keep a record of you, PhyllisBeverlySealPage9120, and with it store information about you -- your ip address, User-Agent, and whether or not you are on a mobile device.  I will also store each 'event' you engage in. This will include the page name, time fetched, and referral page.  Using this information, I can create effective visualizations of traffic on my network, whilst allowing my guests to remain personally anonymous.  As always, feel free to look at the <a href="https://github.com/buckmaxwell/maxwellbuck.com">code for my website</a>, and please write me with your comments and critiques.</p>
